We are very happy to announce that we have opened a new office in Manchester.

## Why Manchester?

Manchester is a wonderfully vibrant city with a lively tech scene and very active tech communities, which is very aligned to our values at Codurance. We hope to provide a home for some of the talented developers who help make this city and it’s communities so great.

We see Manchester as a prominent city when it comes to Agile and Software Craftsmanship, and quite a few companies are already keen to work with us.

Manchester is a great city and a place where many of us from Codurance would love to be. We think that London, Manchester and Barcelona are some of the best cities in Europe to work and live. We envisage a close connection between the three offices. Good rail links between London and Manchester, and the many direct flights every day between all three cities will make it easy for our people to collaborate across our offices.

## What’s next?

We are looking for talented software craftspeople to join us in Manchester. Once they join us, we would love to have them spending some time with us in London to meet the rest of the team.

If you are a developer and would like to join us, please check our [careers page](https://codurance.com/careers/) and drop us a line. If you would like to find out more about our services then have a look [here](https://codurance.com/services/).
