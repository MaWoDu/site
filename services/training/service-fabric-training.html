                        <strong>Microsoft Service Fabric is a distributed systems platform that makes it easy to package, deploy,
                            and manage scalable and reliable microservices. </strong>This course will take attendees right
                        from the basics of microservice architectures and Actor-based programming models, all the way up
                        to building distributed, scalable stateless and stateful microservices with horizontal scalability
                        and zero downtime. The course will be hands-on and attendees will be building their own solutions
                        on Microsoft Azure and local Service Fabric clusters. </p>
