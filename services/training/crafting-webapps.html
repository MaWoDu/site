            <h3>Content</h3>

            <h4>Day 1</h4>
            <p>The first day is dedicated to software design at coding level. Developers will work in pairs on two large exercises, using different TDD styles and comparing their solutions. The day is also full of design discussions around the exercises and real world scenarios.</p>

            <ul>
                <li>Dependency management</li>
                <li>Ecosystem (webpack, babel, create-react app/ vue-cli, jest, enzyme...)</li>
                <li>TDD (inside out and outside in)</li>
                <li>ES6 syntax (async await,Destructuring, high order functions)</li>
                <li>Snapshot testing</li>
                <li>Testing Pyramide</li>
                <li>Contract driven development</li>
                <li>application design layer (services, etc)</li>
                <li>Coordinating with other teams (Backend, Design, QA...)</li>
                <li>Design at application level in a way that expresses what the application does</li>
                <li>Atomic Design</li>
            </ul>

            <h4>Day 2</h4>
            <p>The second day is dedicated to software design at application level (internal structure, layers, components, delivery mechanism, core domain) and also at micro services level using business requirements to drive their design (define the responsibility of each service, how services collaborate, their internal and external visibility, number of services we need to create, etc.) Developers will work in groups of 4 and come up with design solutions that later are shared with the wider group. Many design discussions during exercises focused on real world scenarios.</p>

            <ul>
                <li>Breaking legacy frontend (injecting components)</li>
                <li>Acceptance Test</li>
                <li>Central State (Redux, Vuex...)</li>
                <li>Router</li>
                <li>Integration with frameworks (Material Design, Bootstrap...)</li>
                <li>Refactoring</li>
                <li>Server Side Rendering</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <div class="g-mb-20">
            <h3>Audience</h3>

            <ul>
                <li>Have at least a couple of years of experience developing software commercially.</li>
                <li>Are familiar with at least one Object Oriented Programming language (such as Java, C#, or C++).</li>
                <li>Are comfortable using TDD to build software.</li>
                <li>Understand mock objects and know how to use a mocking library</li>
