First podcast for the new year, from a studio!!!!. And we are talking about something we love: Pair Programming. Listen to [Laurence](https://www.linkedin.com/in/laurencelord/), [Alasdair](https://www.linkedin.com/in/alasdair-smith) and [Mattsi](https://codurance.com/publications/author/mattsi-jansky/) talk about it's use on both your normal workflow and interviews.

As part of the podcast we mentioned the post by [Birgitta BÃ¶ckeler](https://twitter.com/birgitta410) and [Nina Siesseger](https://sssggr.net/): [On Pair Programming](https://martinfowler.com/articles/on-pair-programming.html)
