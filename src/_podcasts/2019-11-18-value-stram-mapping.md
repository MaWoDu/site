**Vocabulary:** </br>
Lead time: One of the most important things, the time it takes for goods to enter your process and for the value or goods to come out of the process. </br>
Cycle time: How long a particular stage takes. </br>
Wait time: The time in between processes. </br>
Queue time: Each stage would most likely not be synchronized with each other, so the previous stage is producing and is queueing up if the next stage is slower.
