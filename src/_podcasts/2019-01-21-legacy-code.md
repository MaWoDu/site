New Year, new podcast available. It is time to talk about Legacy Code. [Sam Davies](https://codurance.com/publications/author/sam-davies/) and [Chris Bimson](https://github.com/christopher-bimson) return, with the new addition of [Andre Torres](https://github.com/andre2w), who this time took charge of the editing.

Links :

[Working Effectively with Legacy Code](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/44919.Working_Effectively_with_Legacy_Code) by Michael C. Feathers. Which is the third, or is it fourth, time that we link it. Do read it. It is that good.
