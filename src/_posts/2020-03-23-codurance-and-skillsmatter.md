As <a href="https://skillsmatter.com/" target="_blank">Skills Matter</a> restarts its operations, we are excited to announce that we will be <a href="https://skillsmatter.com/go/partners/" target="_blank">partnering with Skills Matter</a> at a much deeper level. Together we will provide strategic technical consultancy and project delivery with organisational learning and skills transfer at its very heart. We will also work together to nurture the technical communities supporting and running meet-ups and events together.

Codurance and Skills Matter have a long history of collaboration both commercially and in our community work. We feel that, in some part, we owe our genesis to Skills Matterâ€”they were the home for the London Software Craftsmanship Community for many years.

Since our very beginning, we have pursued a mission to help individuals and businesses continually improve the software craft. The partnership with Skills Matter will have a wider and deeper impact in our industry. We feel this will strengthen our ability to create a lasting positive impact on our clients and within the software development community.
