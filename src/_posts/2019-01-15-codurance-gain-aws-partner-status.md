# Codurance Achieve AWS Partner Status

We are pleased to announce that we have achieved [AWS Consulting Partner status](https://aws.amazon.com/partners/find/partnerdetails/?n=Codurance%20Ltd&id=001E000001dA58LIAS) in the AWS Partner Network. This status recognises the expertise, skill and experience of our Craftspeople with using [AWS](https://aws.amazon.com/) and its services.

We have been working with AWS and cloud-related technologies since the inception of our company. We have been fortunate to work on a range of complex and challenging projects with our existing [clients](clients/), not least with building new applications for [AWS itself](https://floor28.co.il/). As we continue to grow, formalising this partnership became the next logical step.

On the back of this, we have initiated [training programmes](https://aws.amazon.com/partners/training/) for our Craftspeople to ensure that we grow our people and stay ahead of the curve, ensuring that we can continue to offer up to date and relevant solutions and advice to our clients. 
 
We will continue to provide impartial, expert-level advice with our clients, from the perspective of ‘picking the right tool for the job’. By continuing to invest in the skills and expertise of the [AWS](https://aws.amazon.com/) ecosystem, our clients can access depth and breadth of expertise on improving their software delivery capability and journeys to the cloud, where and when AWS is the right solution for them.
