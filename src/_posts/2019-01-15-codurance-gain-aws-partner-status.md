We are pleased to announce that Codurance has achieved [AWS Consulting Partner status](https://aws.amazon.com/partners/find/partnerdetails/?n=Codurance%20Ltd&id=001E000001dA58LIAS) in the AWS Partner Network. This status recognises the expertise, skill and experience of our people in the [AWS Cloud](https://aws.amazon.com/) ecosystem and its various services.

AWS and cloud-related technologies have played an integral role in many of our client engagements. We have been fortunate to work on a range of complex and challenging projects with our existing [clients](/clients/), including the creation of new applications for AWS itself. Establishing a partnership was the next logical step. To ensure that we continue to offer up to date, relevant solutions for our clients, we have introduced internal AWS-specific training across the organisation.

On the back of this, we have initiated [training programmes](https://aws.amazon.com/partners/training/) for our Craftspeople to ensure that we grow our people and stay ahead of the curve, ensuring that we can continue to offer up to date and relevant solutions and advice to our clients.

We will continue to provide impartial, expert-level advice for our clients from the perspective of ‘picking the right tool for the job’. Our continued investment in the skills and expertise around the [AWS](https://aws.amazon.com/) ecosystem will enable our clients to utilise our knowledge on improving their software delivery capabilities and journeys to the cloud.
