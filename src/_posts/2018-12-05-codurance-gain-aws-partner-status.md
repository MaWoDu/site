# Codurance Achieve AWS Partner Status

Since the inception of Codurance we have worked with a number of clients on a wide range of infrastructure platforms from on-prem to cloud deployments.

During 2017 we chose to explore the benefits of the partnership programs provided by the two main cloud providers we work with, AWS and Azure. We are pleased to announce that as of DATE-GOES-HERE Codurance are now officially AWS partners.

A key aspect of the partnership status is that Codurance have to meet, and maintain, specified minimum criteria as laid out by AWS. We intend that this partnership will both assure and inform clients of our capabilities on the AWS platform. For those not familiar with the partner network, the main criteria are:

## In The Future

At aws:reinvent, Amazon announced a significant overhaul of the partner program. Yes, virtually as soon as we gained accreditation! In our opinion the changes raise the requirements in a positive and logical way.for example  requiring more individuals to gain qualifications, and offering clearly defined pathways for partner progression.
