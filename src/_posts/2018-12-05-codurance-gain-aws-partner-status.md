# Codurance Achieve AWS Partner Status

Since the inception of Codurance we have worked with clients on a broad range of infrastructure platforms, from on-premise to cloud deployments.

During 2017 we chose to explore the benefits of the partnership programs provided by the two main cloud providers we often work with, [AWS](https://aws.amazon.com/) and [Azure](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-gb/). We are pleased to announce that, as of December 2018, Codurance are now officially AWS partners.

A key aspect of the partnership status is that Codurance are required to meet, and maintain, specified minimum capability criteria as laid out by AWS. We intend that this partnership will both inform and assure clients of our capabilities on the AWS platform. For those not familiar with the partner network, the base criteria for the Standard level are:

- 2 Technical Professional Accreditations
- 2 Business Professional Accreditations
- 2 Associate Level Certifications
- 2 Customer References

## In The Future

At AWS re:Invent 2018, Amazon announced [significant changes](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/apn/announcing-changes-to-apn-tiers-benefits-and-requirements-for-2019-and-beyond/) to the partner program. Yes, virtually as soon as we gained partnership status! In our opinion the changes raise the minimum requirements in a positive and logical way. For example requiring more individuals to gain qualifications. AWS are also offering clearly defined partner pathways for partner progression along with an increased focus on partner support.

### EVEN ROUGHER DRAFT!
Codurance were already actively training the team in cloud skills .....? So  official validation is beneficial both internally and externally to our clients.

We intend to assess the APN program with a view to attaining the next level of partnership.
