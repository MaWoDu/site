# Our London Office Has Moved!!!!
## New Address: Codurance Ltd, 3 Sutton Lane, London, EC1M 5PU

We've been hard at work finding a new London office space that caters for the growth of the company and also provides us with a diverse space. 

We found that we had outgrown our previous space so started to look for a space that we could setup dedicated areas for delivery team projects, our apprenticship program, business operations as well as having a multi-functional space that we can use for events, meet ups or running our training courses on site.

The search took a few months but we have found a great space at 3 Sutton Lane, London, EC1M 5PU where we have the 3rd and 4th floors, it's also only a stones throw from our previous office. 

The fit out of new office was recently completed and we moved in at the end June.

Here are a few photos of the new space:-
