## Context

You join a project, new stakeholders with their new requirements, and also new team members which whom you might have never worked before, new expectations, both, from the business and yours.

In addition, you deal with a complete new language, a new landscape of techonologies and a team spread around three different locations.

The challenges are evident and go even beyond those inherent to the project: is key to establish the new team dynamics, how the work is splitted, how requirements are refined and the workload is handled.

There are several pilars to build a team uppon, if you want to levarage the chances your poject to suceed, undoubtely engaging [XP Practies](http://www.extremeprogramming.org/) should be in your table, and embradicing any agile flavour to hanbdle the business delivery workload.

## The Challenge
I am not introducing the practice iteself, as I am assume the reader reached this point with certain degree of understanding of the XP Practices and even without being an actie Pair Programming practitioner, I expect you have at least tried it out at least once, for the good of for the bad. Of course I definitely prefer you had a nice experience, but trust me, is an activity that you won't get the best from it if you don't give it continuity, and many developers object it without even trying it. 

When you and the brand new team agree you'll embrace pair programming as a whole, all code to be sent into production is created by two people working together at a single computer. The best way to pair program is to just sit side by side in front of the monitor. Slide the keyboard and mouse back and forth. 





At this point we are not going to discuss the benefits Pair Programming brings to a high performant team, or a team that aspires to be high performant, we are talking about one of the eXtreme Programming core pratices that flows accross the concrete development team activities and engages with core practices such as [Code Ownership](https://ronjeffries.com/xprog/what-is-extreme-programming/#collective), [Code Standards](https://ronjeffries.com/xprog/what-is-extreme-programming/#coding) and even helps build the [Metaphor](https://ronjeffries.com/xprog/what-is-extreme-programming/#metaphor) of the system accross the team.
