## Context

When you join a project, you might face a brand new world. New stakeholders to deal with, new technological challenges and probably new team members which whom you might have never worked before. On the other hand, new expectations and white paper to start from scratch defining the practices the team is going to embrace based on each of the members background.

The challenge goes beyond those inherent to the project: is key to establish the new team dynamics, how the work is split, how requirements are refined and the workload is handled.

There are several pillars to build a team upon, if you want to leverage the chances your project to succeed, undoubtedly embracing [XP Practies](http://www.extremeprogramming.org/) should be in your table, and engaging any agile flavour to handle the business delivery workload is for sure in the handbook of a good project coordinator.

## The Challenge
Now imagine the team is composed of skilled and experienced members, but they are in different locations, or perhaps working remote, or working alternate days from home, or even in different time zone.

This is a perfectly valid team set up in our brand new highly connected world, and defy the traditional ways of working, and put our engineering practices under the loupe, make us thrive to find the best to coupe with the new context, but still using the best known practices in its essence.
Â 
## Pair Programming
Pair programming is considered a Core Practice among those 12 practices enumerated within the XP scope, and is basically a social activity, is the point where two developers join to work together in the same tool they use to produce their craft, create enriched code that emerges from their interaction.

Working in pairs relates deeply with other core practices such as [Code Ownership](https://ronjeffries.com/xprog/what-is-extreme-programming/#collective), [Code Standards](https://ronjeffries.com/xprog/what-is-extreme-programming/#coding) and even helps build the [Metaphor](https://ronjeffries.com/xprog/what-is-extreme-programming/#metaphor) of the system across the team.

When you and the brand new team agree you'll embrace pair programming as a whole, all code to be sent into production is created by two people working together at a single computer.

The best way to pair program is to just sit side by side in front of the monitor. [Slide the keyboard and mouse back and forth.](http://www.extremeprogramming.org/rules/pair.html)

But, how does this last statement matches with the context presented in the paragraph above?

## Pairing Remote is still pairing
Pair Programming is a demanding activity and remote pairing is even more demanding, but it doesn't need to be even more exhausting, while it also can be done effectively. Here there is a compound of lessons learned that might help your team boost their pair programming experience:

- Requires good and interrupted connections
- Get comfortable headset for your team, avoid microphones that capture too much environmental noise.
- There are dozens of tools available, but stick to a video conference that allows only one driver.
- Ask questions and be prepared to explain, keep your pair engaged
- Is not that simple to say "here" or "there", use the proper method or functions names, use the line numbers to reference a location in the file.
- When information is lacking, use your video tool of reference to invite an external and evacuate doubts
- Eventually you can try mob programming (for me didn't work, but I know many of my colleagues had great experiences doing mob remotely)

The rest is basically use the common sense and the general pairing guidelines. I add some suggestions that might help you throughout your pairing experience:
- Involve the whole team when doing planning meetings, make them feel part and organize the meetings taking remotes into account.
- Have a refined backlog of work, which the whole involved team took part in its creation.
- Share context, make them part of the discussions and own the topic (this is obviously beyond Pair Programming but is IMHO a key factor)
- Shift the pairs and balance skills, as despite not being a mentoring activity, it won't work if none of the pair members has experience on the topic or technology.

We are craftspeople, we like to solve complex problems in the best way possible working in the best way engineering practices encourage. In the hyperconnected context were live, definitely we can find a proper way to still work remotely as effectively as if we are together.

## Conclusion
Pair programming is though, and requires practice and some sort of expertise from the involved people. If you want some maturity on the team. There are many strategies and suggested approaches to tackle such activity.

There are an innumerable amount of developers that object the benefits of it without even trying it. Trust me, try it, give it a run and evaluate the results. You'll be tired but the outcome of your craft will be beneficial for the whole team and you'll also learn from your pair.

And do not allow remote working prevent you from doing it, above I left some hints based on our experience working in a Codurance project where, despite its ups and downs, we managed to work collaboratively as a team with the involvement of Barcelona, London and Manchester team members.
