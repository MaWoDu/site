Following our tradition, last February 28th our team in Barcelona celebrated the first Open Space of the new decade.

The mood in general changes, is a different day where all of us gather in the office and spread across our space to share time and knowledge.

This doesn’t mean it is a relaxing day, rather the contrary, is intense, people start sharing talks, attendees breathe knowledge and receive a lot of information in a short period of time.

Have you ever been in an Open Space? Is an inspiring and fulfilling event, with a set of basic principles:<br>
- Any person taking place in the room is suitable<br>
- Anything happening now is the only thing we can have, basically, pay attention to what is happening around<br>
- Whenever the meeting starts, is the right moment<br>
- Once it’s over, it is over.
    
And only one rule:
-   Two feet rule, which means that if you feel you are not contributing nor learning, you can move freely to another room or take a break.

The most challenging moment of the day is when we stand up in front of a board or a wall where a grid with the set up is visible, all the meeting rooms as columns and the time slots as rows: everyone who is interested in giving a talk, starts to propose a topic and books a slot in a room. Collaboration emerges immediately when there is not enough space for all the talks, or even spontaneously topics emerge to cover free slots.

The event wouldn’t be complete without it’s pauses and breaks, in which we gather again to share some drinks a food, while discussing about the talks content, or even about the projects we are involved in, the clients, the meetups, the reading we are captivated about or even about family, hobbies and spare time.

In this February gathering in Barcelona, we’ve discussed a variety of topics such as:<br>
-   Intuitive physics<br>
-   Celebration and the role of emotion in making change happen<br>
-   Neuro rights
    
Others were about practices and experiences:<br>
-   Emergent design with CRC cards<br>
-   Multitasking and portfolio management<br>
-   A story about remote pairing
    
Or about the industry:<br>
-   The future of FinTech in Spain<br>
-   Anatomy of a monster: a distorted organizational setup<br>
-   The leadership wheel and the 6 leadership styles
    

And there was also space for technical discussions:
-   The easiest monolith extraction in the world<br>
-   Serverless Q&A<br>
-   Reviewing the architecture while drinking mate

The topic with most attendees, tracing some parallelism with what happened in the last [London Open Space](https://codurance.com/2020/02/11/open-space-day-and-serverless/) in January, was the talk about Serverless, which seems to be a trending topic lately around the industry and of course in Codurance we are not extent of that trend, as we are preparing several training sessions for our clients on that, and luckily the experts on the matter could share with us much of the insights their experience has given so far.

On the other hand, the other talk that received recognition was the one discussing the experiences and guidelines about [remote pairing in a Codurance project](https://codurance.com/2020/03/03/remote-pairing-a-true-story/). Both of the talks were widely accepted by the attendees and resulted in a very engaged and fluid debate about the topics reviewed.

Each Open Space concludes with a final closing session, in which, as you can imagine, all the participants gather in the room and review all the talks, one by one, where at least one of the attendees of each talk gives a highlight of the content.

For us it was special, it was the first of the year, the first of the decade and the first in a long run. We commemorated the success with a [cava](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cava_(Spanish_wine)) toast and raised our glasses hoping the best to come.
