#Welcome to our new London office!

We're pleased to announce that we have moved to our new London office. We've been hard at work finding a new London office space that caters for the growth of the company and also provides us with a diverse space.

Our new home will provide more space for our project teams and our Apprentice programs. We now have a larger, multi-functional space, which means we can host even more community meetups, run a wider range of events and bring our training courses on site.

The search took a few months but we have found a great space at 3 Sutton Lane, London, EC1M 5PU where we have the 3rd and 4th floors. It's also only a stone's throw away from our previous office. The fit-out of the new office was recently completed and we moved in at the end of June.

We look forward to welcoming you to our new home!

Here are a few photos of our new space:-
