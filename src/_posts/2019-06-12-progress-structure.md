This is the third and last post (at least for now), on internal workings of Codurance. And this time I will be talking about something that we are currently implementing. This is a direct consequence having the Initiative Circles described on my previous post.

Sandro and Mash (our founders) created Codurance with the idea of having a flat hierarchy. Their own experience lead to this idea. On a company of consultants, with highly skilled employees, a formalized bureaucracy will get on the way of moving forward. Furthermore, in my experience, bureaucracy hinders the agility of a company (there is always a minimum needed).

But a flat hierarchy doesn’t mean that there is no structure to your company. You need structure at two very important points: on dealings with the client, as the structure helps on communication channels; and on the career advancement of your consultants. I am not going to talk about the first type here, though we have been adding it as well. But I will be talking here … well, writing ... about the second.

At Codurance there was some basic structure: Junior, Craftsperson, Principal. But that structure was barely defined. We kind of knew how a person moved from Junior to Craftsperson. We did not have an idea how you could move from Craftsperson. And this is a problem. I recommend you to watch this [presentation](https://youtu.be/jA1Q94d2z10?list=PLBzScQzZ83I_qiY6iuS-jHmp1QvdE8m5_) by [Marco Rodgers](https://www.linkedin.com/in/marcorogers/) or look at his [slides](https://speakerdeck.com/polotek/creating-a-career-ladder-for-engineers) (do both) to understand it. But the gist of it is that people get lost in the middle, without a clear idea of how to move. It was an issue for our juniors because they were left to their own devices to know how to improve. And for senior people because they were left without a way to show their advancement, nor a way to reach that position of Principal.

So out of these concerns we tried before to create some kind of structure, but the effort fizzled out. Yet the concern was important enough that we went a second time into it, this time giving ourselves tight deadlines to make sure that we set it up. So a group of people got together and we created a progression structure.

One of the things that we decided at the beginning is that we were not trying to create the perfect structure. We wanted to create something that was good enough. And we will keep evaluating the system and improving it once we started to see issues with it. 

The other important one is that we are a consultancy, and therefore the skills chosen needed for advancement are to improve our capacity as consultants.

## Progress Structure.
So how is the progress structure setup? We have collections of disciplines, areas where we want people to improve. Each discipline is divided into at most 5 levels. Each level has one or more skills/experience. The idea is that they represent a continuous advancement on the difficulty or knowledge required. Then there is the spider nets, a shape (approximate) of the levels on each discipline that we expect a person at each level to have reached. We want to allow for some flexibility, as some of the “requirements” really depend on being provided of those opportunities. Sometimes people are so well advance around an specific area that compensates for lack on others. But in general, for a consultancy, well rounded invidiuals, that can cover all the job/projects possibilities is better.

A detail that I believe is important is that your career advancement will not depend on someone of higher seniority level vacating a position. Each person progress is its own, and will not be affected by others progression.

## Is a Marathon, not a sprint.
I think this is something that needs to be understood. It takes years to reach Principal level. You need the knowledge and the vast experience. You need to have seen multiple projects, with different characteristics, so for new assignments you can reach into your own drawer of solutions, approaches, tricks to move forward satisfactorily a project. Trying to race here it only leads to disappointment. Or as they saying goes: Rome wasn’t built in a day.

## Mentorship
Mentoring is one of the most important ways in which we can help people to improve and progress. Therefore, we are introducing mentoring (non-compulsory) for every level of seniority. A mentor will become a guide and helper, to allow the mentee to move forwards. We consider important, thought, that is the mentee the one in charge of his/her own progression. The mentor is there to lend a hand, provide advise, and help with getting Codurance to provide the resource/opportunities/solutions that the mentee required.

## Roll Out plan

The roll out plan is all about getting everyone more or less aligned in terms of the future progression, and on the more appropriate seniority level. We do expect people to be all over the place right now, due to the fact that before each was left to find their own path. A 6 month period has been reserved for this. An initial assignment of mentors (based on the mentees preferences) has been made.



How will it go? Time will tell
