##Highly Strung: Understanding your Type System
In this video, Software Craftsman Samir Talwar discusses using your type system to make all these problems go away (at least from the core of your code). As a bonus, one will end up with a much more expressive, readable, maintainable and most importantly, correct code.

Samir has also written a fantastic blog on the topic [which you can find here]("http://codurance.com/2014/10/02/highly-strung/").
